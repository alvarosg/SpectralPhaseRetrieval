# SpectralPhaseRetrieval
Jupyter notebook repository illustrating an example of an spectral phase retrieval algorithm using Fourier transforms.

It essentially shows how, given an oversampled 2D spectrum with unknown spectral phases, an interative approach can be used to converge to the right spatial domain solution.
